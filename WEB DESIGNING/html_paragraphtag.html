<!--Hi htsdsdsml is very cool to learn-->
<p>
about circuit lab?
ans: CircuitLab uses the dynamic model of the elements
 in your circuit work out the voltages and currents in
 your circuit at every time step. This means that it
 is very important to choose an appropriate time step 
for your transient simulation.
</p>

CircuitLab is an in-browser schematic capture and 
circuit simulation software tool to help you 
rapidly design and analyze analog and digital
 electronics systems.
