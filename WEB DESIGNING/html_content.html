GOOGLE originally known as BackRub.
<br>
Google is a search engine that started development in 1996
<br>
 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as a research project
<br>
 at Stanford University to find files on the Internet.
<br>
 Larry and Sergey later decided the name of their search
<br>
 engine needed to change and chose Google,
<br>
 which is inspired from the term googol.
<br>
 The company is headquartered in Mountain View, California.
