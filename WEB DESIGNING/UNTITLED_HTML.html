<p>The Samoyed is a friendly, personable dog. These are intelligent dogs, with a touch of independence.</p>
<p> Bred to live in a tent in very close quarters with their families, they thrive on human company.</p>
<p> Samoyeds will alarm bark and, if left alone for long periods of time, will often develop into nuisance barkers.</p>
